Here is a draft README for a final project on Olist E-commerce Analysis:

# Olist E-commerce Data Analysis

This is the final project for the Data Analytics Bootcamp by XYZ Institute. It provides an analysis of e-commerce data from Olist, an online store in Brazil.

## Project Overview

The Olist dataset contains information on 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allow viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. 

The main goals of this analysis are:

- Understand customer demographics and purchasing patterns
- Analyze product demand and performance 
- Evaluate Olist's business performance
- Provide data-driven recommendations to optimize operations

## Datasets

The analysis uses the following datasets:

- `olist_customers_dataset` - Demographics of 99k customers 
- `olist_geolocation_dataset` - Geolocation info for customers and sellers
- `olist_order_items_dataset` - Order items info including price and freight performance
- `olist_order_payments_dataset` - Payments info including installments and payment types
- `olist_order_reviews_dataset` - Reviews written by customers 
- `olist_orders_dataset` - Order info including status, purchase date, etc.
- `olist_products_dataset` - Product info including weight, dimensions and photos
- `olist_sellers_dataset` - Seller info including geolocation and metrics

## Analysis

The analysis covers:

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Customer segmentation
- Product categorization 
- Statistical modelling of customer lifetime value
- Growth opportunities for top product categories
- Geospatial analysis of customer and seller locations
- Interactive dashboards and visualizations

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the final presentations provides data-driven recommendations to Olist on:

- Improving customer retention
- Optimize product portfolio and pricing
- Seller performance evaluation

The dashboard shows that Olist generated total revenue of 16 million dollars from 2016 to 2018 over a 3 year period. We can see that November 2017 had the highest monthly revenue, likely due to Black Friday sales events. However, while Olist has acquired almost 96,000 total customers, only 2,979 of these are repeat customers. This means the number of repeat buyers is very small compared to new customers. Specifically, the total customers metric is 96096, but the repeat customers metric is only 2979. This suggests that while Olist has succeeded in acquiring lots of new customers, most are only making a one-time purchase. Olist appears to be struggling to convert these new customers into repeat buyers. The large difference between total and repeat customers indicates Olist may need to focus more on getting existing customers to purchase again.

In the chart above, we can see Olist has a total of 2,354 active sellers. I broke this down into sellers active for 3 months (1,508 sellers) and 6 months (791 sellers). This shows that a substantial number of sellers are continuously active on Olist for extended periods. The number of active sellers also increased steadily in 2016, indicating Olist is becoming a platform where sellers want to grow their businesses.

Additionally, most sellers have average scores between 4-4.5 out of 5 stars, suggesting generally good performance. However, Olist should watch out for the few sellers scoring just 1-2 stars, as poor seller performance can greatly impact the attractiveness and competitiveness of the platform.
